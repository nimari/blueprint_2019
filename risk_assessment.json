        "undefined": "Selling to businesses (small, medium and large companies) entails different security requirements than selling to consumers; such differences can be significant, especially when trying to provide a SaaS service/product. Although security and compliance could eventually converge in later stages for many organizations, regardless of their customer base, in many cases the differences are massive during the early stages of the company. As such, the security and compliance concerns and approach(es) will vary based on the customer base."

Consider the entire process of acquiring/storing/accessing this information. Such processes, and associated systems and applications, will likely be in scope for your customer's audit. Depending on the number of records your company will have access to, and the type of information contained in these records, your organization might be considered high risk by your customer - and be subject to a higher security standard. There might be a significant reluctance to host such data, especially data in scope for regulatory requirements (e.g., customer private information), in startup's cloud environments (SaaS). Hence an on-prem option should be evaluated if, in addition to accessing the information, there is a need/potential for such information to be stored in your environment."

        "whyDoesItMatter": "Data Breach",
        "undefined": "While accessing sensitive data within a control environment introduces a set of threats, in most cases existing controls can be leveraged to mitigate some of these threats. Moving sensitive data outside of a customer's controlled environment is generally considered a high or critical risk, especially in a SaaS situation -where the customer has no control over the safeguards in the environment. Oftentimes, the risk introduced by sending sensitive data outside of the organization -to a SaaS provider- is considered significantly higher than whatever risk is being mitigated or opportunity created by the SaaS offering. As such, SaaS providers hosting customer sensitive data should prepare for a high degree of scrutiny during the vendor risk assessment process; the level of scrutiny depends on the maturity of the security program in the customer's organization. While an external attestation might suffice in some cases, a vast majority of CISOs will insist on a higher level of scrutiny and will have an expectation of minimum safeguards -that typically startups will have a very difficult time meeting. For SaaS providers in such situations, we advise developing an offering a customer-managed offering (aside from the SaaS offering); such offering could/should be a turn-key solution, such as containers that can run in a customer environment with little or no remote oversight.

        "undefined": "Depending on the level of sophistication of your customer remote access solutions, your offering might incur higher scrutiny; organizations with relatively ineffective remote access controls - e.g., VPN solutions that operate on all or nothing model - i.e., once connected all systems behind the VPN are accessible, will likely be more concerned with vendors that have remote access to their environments. Such access introduces a new set of risks - in the event your environment is compromised, such access could provide the attacker an avenue to attack their environment (remember the Target breach? it was the HVAC vendor)... Organizations with mature remote access solutions will be able to better control such access, especially if using a zero trust model, leading to reduced risk and potentially less scrutiny.  "

Similar to the risks introduced by storing sensitive data or allowing remote access to 3rd parties, privileged access that is controlled by a 3rd party leads to a high degree of scrutiny for the 3d party. Your customers will want to avoid predicaments similar to Target (breach caused by compromised HVAC vendor) and the difficulty of explaining away why the organization decided to trust a startup, with limited security resources, with the \"keys to the kingdom\". Furthermore, such an arrangement will likely increase your threat profile, as attackers aware of such arrangement will likely target your environment, rather than attacking your customers directly.  \n"

Furthermore, storing credentials for other services used by your customers/users will likely make your organization and service a target for an attacker targeting other services used by your customers - e.g., it is likely easier to break into your environment, if you store credentials for Google users, and steal these credentials, rather than attacking Google directly."
